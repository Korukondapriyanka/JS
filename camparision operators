//  * Equality Operator (==)
//   The Equality operator is used to compare the equality of two operands.




// Illustration of (==) operator
let x = 3;
let y = '3';
​
// Checking of operands
console.log(x == 3);
console.log(y == 3);        
console.log(x == y);
​
console.log();
​
// Check against special values
console.log(NaN == NaN);
console.log(0 == false);   
console.log(0 == null);


//Comparison Operators List
//There are many comparison operators as shown in the table with the description.

OPERATOR NAME                    USAGE                       OPERATION

Equality Operator                a == b           Compares the equality of two operators
Inequality Operator         	   a != b	          Compares inequality of two operators
Strict Equality Operator	       a === b        	Compares both the value and type of the operand
Strict Inequality Operator	     a !== b        	Compares inequality with type
Greater than Operator       	   a > b	          Checks if the left operator is greater than the right operator
Greater than or equal Operator 	 a >= b          	Checks if the left operator is greater than or equal to the right operator
Less than Operator	             a < b          	Checks if the left operator is smaller than the right operator
Less than or equal Operator	     a <= b	          Checks if the left operator is smaller than or equal to the right operator
